The RISC Zero STARK Protocol
The implementation in code for the RISC Zero STARK prover can be seen 
here
.
In this document, we present an overview of the RISC Zero STARK protocol, as well as a sequence diagram and a detailed description below. The 
STARK by Hand
 explainer and the 
RISC Zero ZKP Whitepaper
 are good companions to this document.
Overview
​
RISC Zero's 
receipts
 are built on the shoulders of several recent advances in the world of zero-knowledge cryptography.
The core of the proof system is 
STARK
-based, implementing 
DEEP-ALI & FRI
.
This proof system is used to generate zero-knowledge validity proofs for RISC Zero's RISC-V circuit and RISC Zero's recursion circuit.
Users may also be interested in reading about the 
RISC Zero Groth16 Circuit
, which enables on-chain verification.
At a high level, the design of the RISC Zero STARK protocol is very similar to the system described in 
ethSTARK
, and the system implemented in 
Winterfell
.
Setup Phase
​
The protocol includes a two-part setup phase; the first setup happens once per zkVM version, and the second setup establishes the Image ID for a given RISC-V binary file.
Part 1: Circuit Setup
​
This setup is transparent and establishes the public parameters for the prover & verifier.
These public parameters include the number and length of the trace columns, the choice of hash function and Merkleization structure, as well as a full enumeration of the constraints that are to be enforced.
Part 2: Program Setup
​
This phase establishes an 
Image ID
, which is determined transparently from a RISC-V binary file and the circuit parameters.
The 
Image ID
 is constructed by loading the RISC-V binary file into the zkVM memory, and then recording a Merkle snapshot of the full machine state.
This setup can be repeated by anyone with access to the binary file, in order to confirm the correctness of the 
Image ID
.
Main Trace & Auxiliary Trace
​
After the setup phase, the Prover executes the binary in the zkVM, computes a Low-Degree Extension on each column, and commits the 
Extended Main Execution Trace
.
Then, the prover computes and commits the 
Extended Auxiliary Execution Trace
 which depends on verifier randomness.
Compared to 
ethSTARK
, our protocol adds an additional round of interaction to support constraints beyond basic AIR constraints.
Using constraints that may span both the main trace and the auxiliary trace, we proceed with 
DEEP-ALI & FRI
 as described in 
ethSTARK
.
Adding an Auxiliary Execution Trace enables various enhancements, relative to a Vanilla STARK protocol.
These enhancements are described well in 
From AIRs to RAPs
.
We use this Auxiliary Execution Trace to support:
A permutation argument for 
memory verification

The permutation argument is currently implemented as a grand product accumulator argument, as in 
PLONK
.
We plan to change this to a 
log derivative
 accumulator argument in the next version of the circuit.

Here, operations corresponding to memory are committed to the main trace both in the original ordering and the permuted ordering, and grand product accumulators are committed in the auxiliary trace.
A lookup argument for range checks

The lookup argument is currently implemented using the approach described in 
PLOOKUP
.
We plan to change this to a 
log derivative
 accumulator argument in the next version of the circuit. 

Here, the tables and the witness are committed in the main trace, and grand product accumulators are committed in the auxiliary trace.
A big integer accelerator to enable 
fast cryptographic operations

The bigint accelerator implements multiplication of 
a
 and 
b
 by asking the host to provide the product 
c
 as non-deterministic advice. Then, the verifier provides randomness 
r
, and the constraints enforce that when 
a
, 
b
, and 
c
 are interpreted as polynomials, 
a(r) * b(r) == c(r)
. 

Here, 
a
, 
b
, and 
c
 are committed in the main trace, and the evaluations at 
r
 are committed in the auxiliary trace.
DEEP-ALI & FRI
​
The rest of the protocol implements with 
DEEP-ALI & FRI
 as described in 
EthSTARK
.
We describe this in more detail below, and refer readers to the 
ZKP Whitepaper
 for a more formal description of the protocol.

Detailed Step-by-Step Description
​
In this section, we elaborate on the sequence diagram above.
For a more formal articulation of the protocol, refer to the 
ZKP Whitepaper
.
Extended Main Execution Trace
​
The Prover runs a computation in order to generate an 
Execution Trace
.

The 
trace
 is organized into 
columns
, and the columns are categorized as 
control columns
, 
data columns
, and 
auxiliary/accum columns
.

The 
control columns
 handle system initialization and shutdown, the initial program code to load into memory before execution, and other control signals that don't depend on the program execution.
The 
data columns
 contain the input and the computation data, both of which are private. These columns are committed in two orderings:

in order of program execution, and
re-ordered by register first and clock cycle second. The re-ordered columns allow for efficient validation of RISC-V memory operations.
The 
auxiliary/accum columns
 are used for a permutation argument, a lookup argument, and a big integer accelerator circuit.
After computing the 
data columns
 and 
auxiliary/accum columns,
 the Prover adds some random 
noise
 to the end of those columns in order to ensure that the protocol is zero-knowledge.
The Prover encodes the 
trace
 as follows:

The Prover converts each 
column
 into a polynomial using an 
iNTT
. We'll refer to these as 
Trace Polynomials
, denoted 
P
i
(
x
)
P_i(x)
P
i
​
(
x
)
.
The Prover evaluates the 
data polynomials
 and the 
control polynomials
 over an expanded domain. The evaluations of the 
data polynomials
 and the 
control polynomials
 over this larger domain is called the 
Extended Main Execution Trace
.
The Prover commits the 
Extended Main Execution Trace
 into two separate Merkle Trees, sending the roots to the Verifier.
Extended Auxiliary Execution Trace
​
Using the transcript-thus-far as an entropy-source, we choose some random extension field elements, using a SHA-2 CRNG.
Then, the Prover uses the randomness to generate the 
auxiliary/accum columns
. The Prover computes the Low-Degree Extension of the auxiliary columns to form the Extended Auxiliary Execution Trace.
The Prover commits the Extended Auxiliary Execution Trace to a Merkle tree and sends the Merkle root to the Verifier.
Using the transcript-thus-far as an entropy-source, we choose a random 
constraint mixing parameter
α
\alpha
α
, using a SHA-2 CRNG.
DEEP-ALI (part 1)
​
The Prover uses the 
constraint mixing parameter
, the 
Trace Polynomials
, and the 
Rule Checking Polynomials
 to construct a few 
Low Degree Validity Polynomials.
 The details are as follows:

.

The key point about these polynomials is that for each of the 
k
k
k
 rules and each input 
z
z
z
 that's associated with the trace, 
C
j
(
z
)
C_j(z)
C

​
(

)
 will return 0 if the trace "passes the test," so to speak.
Using the 
constraint mixing parameter

Constraint Polynomials

Using a publicly known 
Zeros Polynomial
, the Prover computes the 
High Degree Validity Polynomial
, 
V
(
x
)
=
C
(

)
Z
(
x
)
V(x)=\frac{C(x)}{Z(x)}
V
(
x
)
=
Z
(
x
)
C
(
x
)
​
.

The 
Zeros Polynomial
Z
(
x
)
Z(x)
Z
(
x
)
 is a divisor of any honest construction of 
C
(
x
)
C(x)
C
(
x
)
.
In other words, an honest prover will construct 
V
(
x
)
V(x)
V
(
x
)
 to be a polynomial of lower degree than 
C
(
x
)
C(x)
C
(
x
)
.
We call 
V
V
V
 "high degree" relative to the Trace Polynomials, 
P
i
P_i
P

​
.
The Prover 
splits
 the 
High Degree Validity Polynomial
 into 4 
Low Degree Validity Polynomials
,

...
,
v

​
.
The Prover evaluates the 
Low Degree Validity Polynomials
, encodes them in a Merkle Tree, and sends the Merkle root to the Verifier.
We use Fiat-Shamir to choose an out-of-domain evaluation point, 
z
z
z
.
DEEP-ALI (part 2)
​
The Verifier would like to check the asserted relation between 
C
C
C
, 
Z
Z
Z
, and 
V
V
V
 at the 
DEEP Test Point,
z
z
z
.
Namely, the Verifier would like to confirm that 
V
(
z
)
Z
(
z
)
=
C
(
z
)
V(z)Z(z)=C(z)
V
(
z
)
Z
(
z
)
=
C
(
z
)
.

The Prover sends the evaluations of each 
v
i
v_i
v
i
​
 at 
z
z
z
, which allows the Verifier to compute 
V
(
z
)
V(z)
V
(
z
)
.
Computing 
C
(
z
)
C(z)
C
(
z
)
 is slightly more complicated. Because 
rule checks
 can check relationships across multiple 
columns
 and multiple 
clock cycles
, evaluating 
C
(
z
)
C(z)
C
(
z
)
 requires numerous evaluations of the form 
P
i
(
ω
n
z
)
P_i(\omega^nz)
P
i
​
(
ω
n
z
)
 for varying 
columns
i
i
i
 and 
cycles
n
n
n
.
The Prover sends these 
necessary evaluations
 of each 
P
i
P_i
P
i
​
 to allow the Verifier to evaluate 
C
(
z
)
C(z)
C
(
z
)
.
We refer to the 
necessary evaluations
P
i
(
ω
n
z
)
P_i(\omega^nz)
P
i
​
(
ω
n
z
)
 as the 
taps
 of 
P
i
P_i
P
i
​
 at 
z
z
z
.
The Verifier can now check 
V
(
z
)
Z
(
z
)
=
C
(
z
)
V(z)Z(z)=C(z)
V
(
z
)
Z
(
z
)
=
C
(
z
)
.
Although these asserted evaluations have no associated Merkle branches, the DEEP technique offers an alternative to the usual Merkle proof.
The Prover constructs the DEEP polynomials using the 
taps
:

Denoting the 
taps
 of 
P
i
P_i
P
i
​
 at 
z
z
z
 as 
(
x
1
,
P
i
(
x

)
)
,
…
,
(
x
n
,
P
i
(
x
n
)
)
(x_1,P_i(x_1)),\ldots,(x_n,P_i(x_n))
(
x
1
​
,
P
i
​
(
x
1
​
))
,
…
,
(
x
n
​
,
P
i
​
(
x
n
​
))
, the Prover constructs the DEEP polynomial 
P
i
′
(
x
)
=
P
i
(
x
)
−
P
i
‾
(
x
)
(
x
−
x
1
)
…
(
x
−
x
n
)
P'_i(x)=\frac{P_i(x)-\overline{P_i}(x)}{(x-x_1)\ldots(x-x_n)}
P
i
′
​
(
x
)
=
(
x
−
x
1
​
)
…
(
x
−
x
n
​
)
P
i
​
(
x
)
−
P
i
​
​
(
x
)
​
 where 
P
i
‾
(
x
)
\overline{P_i}(x)
P
i
​
​
(
x
)
 is the polynomial formed by interpolating the taps of 
P
i
P_i
P
i
​
. The Prover computes 
P
i
′
P'_i
P
i
′
​
, runs an iNTT on the result, and sends the coefficients of 
P
i
′
P'_i
P
i
′
​
 to the Verifier.
Using this technique, the Prover constructs and sends a DEEP polynomial for each 
P
i
P_i
P
i
​
 and each 
v
i
v_i
v
i
​
.
At this point, the claim of trace validity has been reduced to the claim that each of the DEEP polynomials is actually a low-degree polynomial.
To conclude the proof, the Prover mixes the DEEP polynomials into the 
FRI Polynomial
 using a 
DEEP mixing parameter
 and use the FRI protocol to show that the 
FRI Polynomial
 is a low-degree polynomial.
The FRI Protocol

We omit the details of the 
DEEP-ALI & FRI
 for brevity.
